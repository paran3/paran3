#### HI! I am Taemin Kim.
- started programming because I was fascinated by the logical thinking of computers.
- take great responsibility of the project's schedule and try to create bug-free programs.
- I am excited with difficult and new challenges, and enjoy the thrill of finding answers there.
- try not to deviate, I try to look back on myself.
- Rather than just Googling, I try to find and understand the standard documentation or official documentation first.
- Design is the most important thing, and strive to make good designs.
