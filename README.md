#### HI! This is Taemin Kim.
- I started programming because I was fascinated by the logical thinking of computers.
- I take great responsibility for the project's schedule and try to create bug-free programs.
- I am excited about difficult and new challenges, and enjoy the thrill of finding answers there.
- I try not to deviate, I try to look back on myself.
- Rather than just Googling, I try to find and understand the standard documentation or official documentation first.
- Design is the most important thing, and I strive to make good designs.
